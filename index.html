			<h2>A little about Me</h2>
			<p>For as long as I can remember, I have had a passion for deconstructing and rebuilding 
				things. I would take apart remotes and toys and then put them back together. As I grew 
				older, remotes and toys became computers and consoles. Nowadays, I find I spend a lot 
				of my time trying to take apart or tinker with the functionality of webpages or 
				conceptualizing different applications one could create.
			</p>
			<p>It is out of this curiosity that my desire to learn to program was born. Too many of my 
				interactions with software, applications, hardware, websites, etc., had me asking, 
				"How would I improve this?" I have now learned the tools and techniques to build, 
				amend, and deconstruct all of these things of interest to me. Working alongside 
				others with these same interests has been one of the most rewarding aspects of this 
				journey. Bouncing ideas off of one another, piggy-backing on one another's suggestions, 
				and creating things that far exceed the skillset of just one of us is one of my 
				favorite things about this career field. I look forward to continuing this aspect 
				in particular by becoming part of a team of Software Developers.
			</p>
			<p>Outside of coding, I am an avid gym-goer. My journey in the gym mirrors that which 
				I expect my journey as a developer will be. That is to say, the more I know, and 
				the better I get in the gym, the more aware I become about just how much I don't 
				know and how much more I can learn. That excites me about fitness, and it excites 
				me about programming.
			</p>
			<p>For you and your company, I can help design and build algorithms. I can produce 
				efficient and elegant code to meet the requirements of you or your client. 
				I can test and deploy programs and troubleshoot, debug, maintain,
				and improve existing software. Finally, I will develop technical documentation 
				for future projects.
			</p>

				<p>This application came not long after the project for the local Library. 
					Like that project, I used mainly HTML, CSS, and JS to build the display 
					and functionality of this web application. The bulk of the work centered 
					around manipulating text strings or number couplings and converting them 
					into encoded or decoded messages through switch-case, conditionals, 
					ternaries, etc. I again used Test-Driven development to troubleshoot as 
					I constructed the application.

	  <h4><a href="https://github.com/ChrisThinkful/first-assignment" target="_blank">Local Library</a></h4>
				<p>I completed this project early on in my career. I designed the algorithms 
					that would display data for a local library. I utilized Test-Driven 
					development to troubleshoot my code as I worked through the project. 
					I used high-order functions and other modern javascript techniques to 
					provide a means for the library to display things like popular genres 
					or authors and provide a search mechanism for a given user, author, book, etc.
