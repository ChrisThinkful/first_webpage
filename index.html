			<h2>A little about Me</h2>
			<p>As a self-proclaimed geek and avid pc-gamer, it was only natural that
				I would, eventually, find my way to programming. All too often I was
				curious about the inner-workings of all the programs or platforms I 
				used on a daily basis - from MMORPGs/ARPGs to Social Media to music 
				platforms like Spotify. All of these am I interested in learning to 
				actually build from the ground up.</p>
			<p>As a father, son, brother, and friend, I have had no shortage of 
				experiences with like and unlike-minded people, and, while both have
				taught me many lessons, I am very eager to work alongside people who have
				similar interests and passions as myself. Whether those people are 
				leading and mentoring me or the reverse, I thrive in situations
				where the team builds off of one another. Hopefully, you and I will be
				able to create and debug something together in the near future.
