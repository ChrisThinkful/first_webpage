			<h2>A little about Me</h2>
			<p>For as long as I can remember, I have had a passion for desconstructing and rebuilding things. 
				I would take apart remotes and toys, and then put them back together. As I grew older, remotes and toys 
				became computers and consoles. Nowadays, I find I spend a lot of my time trying to take apart or tinker 
				with the functionality of webpages, or conceptualizing different applications one could create.
			</p>
			<p>It is out of this curiosity that my desire to learn programming was born. Too many of my interactions with 
				software, applications, hardware, websites, etc. had me asking, "How would I improve this?" I have now learned 
				the tools and techniques to build, amend, and deconstruct all of these things which were of interest to me. Working 
				alongside of others with these same interests has been one of the most rewarding aspects to this journey. Bouncing 
				ideas off of one another, piggy-backing on one another's suggestions and creating things that far exceed the 
				skillset of just one of us is one of my favorite things about this career field. I look forward to continuing 
				this aspect in particular by becoming part of a team of Software Developers.
			</p>
			<p>Outside of coding, I am an avid gym-goer. My journey in the gym mirrors that which I expect my journey as 
				a developer will be. That is to say, the more I know and the better I get in the gym, the more aware I 
				become about just how much I don't know and how much more I can learn. That excites me about fitness and 
				it excites me about programming. 
			</p>
			<p>For you and your company, I can help design and build algorithms. I can produce efficient and elegant code to 
				meet the requirements of you or your client. I am able to test and deploy programs, as well as, troubleshoot, debug, maintain, 
				and improve existing software. Finally, I will develop technical documentation for future projects.
			</p>
